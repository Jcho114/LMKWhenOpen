# LMKWhenOpen

## Overview

LMKWhenOpne is a NodeJS program used to notify user when seats for a certain college class are open.

This repository contains code snippets of the implementation of the bot itself, but no code related to hosting the program on firebase.

## Motivation

I constructed the program to avoid a particular university professor if possible.

## Tech

## Future
LMKWhen is currently only used for personal use. Maybe, in the future when I have more time, I can make it for general use.
